    - If you want to join the same channel from different devices, ensure that the UIDs in all devices are different.
    - Ensure that the app ID you use to generate the token is the same with the app ID used when creating the `AgoraRtcChannel` object.

    @param token The token for authentication:
    - In situations not requiring high security: You can use the temporary token generated at Console. For details, see [Get a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token?platfor%20*%20m=All%20Platforms#get-a-temporary-token).

    @param info (Optional) Additional information about the channel. This parameter can be set as null. Other users in the channel do not receive this information.
    @param uid The user ID. A 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 1 to (232-1). This parameter must be unique. If `uid` is not assigned (or set as `0`), the SDK assigns a `uid` and reports it in the \ref onJoinChannelSuccess callback. The app must maintain this user ID.

    @note To ensure smooth communication, use the same parameter type to identify the user. For example, if a user joins the channel with a user ID, then ensure all the other users use the user ID too. The same applies to the user account.
    If a user joins the channel with the Agora Web SDK, ensure that the uid of the user is set to the same parameter type.
